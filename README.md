# UCD Course Offering PDF Parser
- Created for another project in mind
- Utitlizes PyPDF2 in order to read pdf, which runs alot faster than pdfMiner.six
- Using Regular Expressions (Regex), re API inorder to parse through each line of what I need

## Problems encountered
Using pdfMiner as my first initial api in order to process pdfs proved to be slow and inefficent. PyPDF2 gets what I need and gives me similar results.
